What is COTTACHAIN?

COTTACHAIN is a decentralized reputation system built on Solana, fostering trust and transparency across Web3 and Web2 platforms. It assigns portable, verifiable reputation scores based on on-chain activities transactions, governance, or dApp interactions seamlessly usable in DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, e-commerce, and social media. Powered by the COTTA token, COTTACHAIN ensures user controlled, fraud resistant trust through audited smart contracts.

Why is COTTACHAIN Useful?

Centralized reputation systems (e.g., Amazon’s seller ratings, X’s verified checks) are siloed, manipulable, and prone to fraud. COTTACHAIN solves this by offering:

Portability: Use your reputation score across platforms, from Magic Eden to Etsy-like marketplaces.

Transparency: Verifiable, tamper-proof scores via Solana’s high-throughput blockchain.

Fraud Resistance: Mitigate bots and Sybil attacks with on-chain activity-based scoring.

Broad Applicability: Enhances trust in DeFi lending, DAO voting, NFT trading, and social media influence.

COTTACHAIN empowers developers to build trust-driven dApps and enables users to own their reputation, redefining trust for the decentralized internet.
